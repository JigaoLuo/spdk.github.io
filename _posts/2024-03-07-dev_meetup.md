Come and join us for the 4th SPDK Developer Meetup, hosted by Intel in the picturesque city of Gdansk, Poland!

This event will be an exceptional opportunity for networking, learning, coding, and community building. With a diverse range of topics to be covered, there's something for everyone!

Rather than traditional presentations, our agenda will focus on following types of activities:

- Technical introductory interactive presentations (optional), tailored for contributors who are relatively new and seeking to solidify their understanding of key concepts.
- Open discussions and brainstorming sessions on new features or process improvements.
- Collaborative whiteboard design work.
- Code walkthroughs.
- Dedicated time for focused work on specific patches to aid in their approval process.

We'll kick off the event with agenda building, followed by breakout sessions aligned with attendees' interests.

As seating is limited, please RSVP as soon as possible to secure your spot! Attendance will be restricted to 2 engineers per company, with a few exceptions for those actively contributing to SPDK. Confirmation and further details will be sent via email.

This year, we're starting on Monday mid-morning to accommodate early travel, and concluding on Tuesday evening.

Thank you!<br/>
Tomek
