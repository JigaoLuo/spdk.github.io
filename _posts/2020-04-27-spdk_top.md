A new application has just joined SPDK family - spdk_top. Designed to resemble standard
top, spdk_top provides additional insight into SPDK cores, lightweight threads, and
pollers. Have you ever wondered which core is used most by your SPDK instance? Are you
building your own bdev or library and want to know if your code is running efficiently?
Are your new pollers busy most of the time? You can check that now with spdk_top and
tune your implementation with the provided information to get even more from SPDK!
