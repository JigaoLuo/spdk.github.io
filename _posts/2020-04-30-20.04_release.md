On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 20.04](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v20.04)!

This release contains the following new features:

- **SPDK Top:** Added application to allow users to monitor resource consumption by a running SPDK application.
- **NVMe qpair groups:** Added API to allow for pooling of NVMe qpairs across a single entity.
- **OCF:** Added support for OCF v20.03.
- **Crypto bdev:** Added support for AES_XTS for the QAT polled mode driver.
- **IDXD:** Added support for IDXD as an accel plug-in module allowing for use with the generic accel framework API. This feature is considered as experimental.

Note: Legacy INI style configuration for SPDK applications has been deprecated and will be removed in future release. Please switch to JSON-RPC configuration files and/or RPC driven run-time configuration.

The full changelog for this release is available [here](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v20.04).
