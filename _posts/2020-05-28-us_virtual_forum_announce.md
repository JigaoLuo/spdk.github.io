## What is PMDK?

[PMDK](https://pmem.io/pmdk) is a vendor-neutral, growing collection of
libraries started by Intel, motivated by the introduction of
[Optane DC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-dc-persistent-memory.html)
persistent memory. PMDK will work with any persistent memory that provides the
[SNIA NVM Programming Model](https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/technical_work/final/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.2.pdf).
These libraries have been developed for various use cases, tuned, validated to
production quality, and thoroughly documented.

## What is Intel® VTune™ Amplifier?
[Intel® VTune™ Amplifier](https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune) collects key
profiling data needed to optimize modern polled I/O that uses SMDK or PMDK.
It also has analyses to optimize the use and configuration of the latest
Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory. Also featuring [Intel® Inspector - Persistence
Inspector](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/detect-persistent-memory-programming-errors-with-intel-inspector-persistence-inspector).
