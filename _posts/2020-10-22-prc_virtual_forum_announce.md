## What is SPDK?
[SPDK](https://spdk.io/) is a storage reference software development kit started for latest non-volatile media, designed to allow for millions of IOPS per core, while reducing both average and tail latency, all with an open source license. SPDK’s framework can be leveraged to build optimized user space storage solutions in many storage scenarios such as storage virtualization, network storage, database, etc.

## What is PMDK?
[PMDK](https://pmem.io/pmdk) is a vendor-neutral, growing collection of libraries started by Intel, motivated by the introduction of [Intel® Optane™ persistent memory](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-dc-persistent-memory.html) persistent memory. PMDK will work with any persistent memory that provides the [SNIA NVM Programming Model](https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/technical_work/final/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.2.pdf). These libraries have been developed for various use cases, tuned, validated to production quality, and thoroughly documented.

## What is Intel® VTune™ Amplifier?
[Intel® VTune™ Amplifier](https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune) collects key profiling data needed to optimize modern polled I/O that uses SPDK or PMDK. It also has analyses to optimize the use and configuration of the latest Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory. Also featuring [Intel® Inspector - Persistence Inspector](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/detect-persistent-memory-programming-errors-with-intel-inspector-persistence-inspector).
