On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 21.01 LTS](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v21.01)!!

The SPDK 21.01 release is a long term support release that will be supported for 1 year.

This release contains the following new features:

- **Dynamic scheduler:** SPDK lightweight threads are now scheduled onto reactors in SPDK's event framework dynamically. The scheduler rebalances idle threads, adjusts CPU frequency, and turns idle reactors to interrupt mode. Please see [scheduler documentation](https://www.spdk.io/doc/scheduler.html) for details. This feature is considered experimental.
- **vfio-user NVMe-oF transport:** Added support for the new vfio-user NVMe-oF transport that emulates an NVMe device over shared memory to a virtual machine or separate process. This feature is considered experimental.
- **vfio-user NVMe transport:** Added support for the vfio-user NVMe transport to allow connecting to emulated NVMe devices directly from a process. This feature is considered experimental.
- **NVMe ZNS Zone Append:** Added support for the Zone Append command from the Zoned Namespace Command Set.
- **pkg-config:** SPDK now generates pkg-config files to simplify the process of determining which libraries must be linked into an SPDK application. See [pkg-config](https://spdk.io/doc/pkgconfig.html).
- **DPDK:** Added support for DPDK 20.11.

Users updating from the previous 20.01 LTS release should note that legacy configuration (.ini) files have been removed in favor of JSON-RPC. Please see [jsonrpc_convert](https://spdk.io/doc/jsonrpc.html#jsonrpc_convert) for information on the new configuration mechanism.

The full changelog for this release is available [here](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v21.01).

This release contains 587 commits from 45 authors with over 31k lines of code changed.
