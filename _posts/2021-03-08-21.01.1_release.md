On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 21.01.1](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v21.01.1) LTS.

## SPDK 21.01.1 LTS


### dpdk

Added `rte_ethdev` and `rte_net` dependencies for all builds with DPDK.

Fixed compatibility issues with DPDK 19.11.

### iscsi

A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in the SPDK iSCSI target.
A TEXT PDU with no data, but CONTINUE flag set, would result in a NULL pointer dereference
and crash the SPDK iSCSI target process. All users of the SPDK iSCSI target
are recommended to update. All SPDK versions <= v21.01 are affected.

### nbd

Fixed kernel hang when bdev is removed by always setting NBD_SET_TIMEOUT.

### nvme

Fixed segfault when removing qpair when transport connection fails (issue #1777).

### ocssd

Fixed the bug that no media event is pushed to the target bdev.

### sock

Added `enable_quickack` and `enable_placement_id` when saving JSON configuration.

Thanks to everyone for your contributions, participation, and effort!
