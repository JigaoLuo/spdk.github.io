On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the releases of [SPDK 20.01.2](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v20.01.2) LTS
and [SPDK 20.04.1](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v20.04.1)!

## SPDK 20.01.2 LTS

### dpdk

Updated DPDK submodule to DPDK 19.11.2, which includes fixes for DPDK vulnerabilities:
CVE-2020-10722, CVE-2020-10723, CVE-2020-10724, CVE-2020-10725, CVE-2020-10724.

### env_dpdk

A new function, `spdk_mem_reserve`, has been added to reserve a memory region in SPDK's
memory maps. It pre-allocates data structures to hold memory address translations
without populating the region.

### rpc

A new RPC, `bdev_rbd_resize` has been added to resize the Ceph RBD bdev.

### GitHub issues
- **Fix #1291:** lib/blob: merge EP of a clone when deleting a snapshot
- **Fix #1292:** nvme/rdma: Wait for completions of both RDMA RECV and SEND

## SPDK 20.04.1

### dpdk

Updated DPDK submodule to DPDK 19.11.2, which includes fixes for DPDK vulnerabilities:
CVE-2020-10722, CVE-2020-10723, CVE-2020-10724, CVE-2020-10725, CVE-2020-10724.

Thanks to everyone for your contributions, participation, and effort!
